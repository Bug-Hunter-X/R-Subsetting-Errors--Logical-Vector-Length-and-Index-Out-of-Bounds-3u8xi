# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a logical vector that is one element shorter than the data frame.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
logic_vector <- df$a > 2  #This will be length 5

subset_df <- df[logic_vector[1:4], ] #This will subset correctly

#The error is in the following line: Incorrect subsetting causing unexpected behavior.
print(subset_df)

#Another example using wrong row index. Note that df has 5 rows. 
wrong_index <- c(1, 2, 6) 
print(df[wrong_index, ])
